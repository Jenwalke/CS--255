# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The Clint is DriverPass, company that tries to help students get the resources that could help them pass exams and tests to get their drivers license. The system would be a web face system that helped organize the users and help them have accounts and put their information, life payment information and their identity in a secure area while they're getting the information they need to study.
# What did you do particularly well?
I thought that I did well in the evaluating of diagrams, and the initial interview of trying to see what the client wanted. It also was some of the diagrams I thought I did well for was the use case diagram, and the activity diagrams. I thought about I had a better understanding of those things than some other materials that were thought in the coursework.
